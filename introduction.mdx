## Djosend

Discover the sms platform that will combine ease and robustness in your (one-off and mass) communication with your customers.

Djosend lets you send sms from a web dashboard. Djosend offers you two communication methods

- Dashboard: It's a web interface where you can log in with your access details and take advantage of the following functionalities
- API Interface: Send sms to your customers directly from an API call, without having to use the dashboard

In this documentation you'll find all the information you need about the direct API communication method.

The current version of Djosend allows you to

- Create direct and scheduled sms campaigns
- Send unique messages
- Send mass sms

Because we have thought of everyone according to their system, you will be able to execute requests on djosend via

- XML
- JSON
